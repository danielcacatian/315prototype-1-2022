**Design Hypothesis**<br>
For this prototype, I wanted to explore a different genre of a top-down game that combines 2D and 3D. Most top-down videogames follow a 2D format such as top-down shooters, arcade-style where you get the high score, and RPGs. Some games take a top-down format with 3D aspects, but they do not fully utilize the capabilities of having 3D aspects. One tends to overcome the other. I believe both can co-exist in a videogame where both excel equally. I use this prototype to see if such a thing is possible. I came up with a top-down adventure game on top of buildings. This scenario takes advantage of being 3D by potentially giving a sense of vertigo to the player with the top-down view of being on top of a building while having 2D gameplay. For this prototype, I focused mainly on the 2D gameplay and how it feels in a 3D environment.

**Playtest Questions**<br>
1. Is the perception of height noticeable during gameplay?
2. Does the gameplay fit the genre of a top-down adventure game?
3. Does the camera movement feel smooth?
4. Do you find it difficult to perceive a depth of field during gameplay?
5. Do you believe this can be realized as a full fledge game with a narrative?
6. Does this feel diffirent than other top-down games you've played?
