#### **Design Hypothesis**<br>
For this prototype, I wanted to explore a different genre of a top-down game that combines 2D and 3D. Most top-down videogames follow a 2D format such as top-down shooters, arcade-style where you get the high score, and RPGs. Some games take a top-down format with 3D aspects, but they do not fully utilize the capabilities of having 3D aspects. One tends to overcome the other. I believe both can co-exist in a videogame where both excel equally. I use this prototype to see if such a thing is possible. I came up with a top-down adventure game on top of buildings. This scenario takes advantage of being 3D by potentially giving a sense of vertigo to the player with the top-down view of being on top of a building while having 2D gameplay. For this prototype, I focused mainly on the 2D gameplay and how it feels in a 3D environment.
