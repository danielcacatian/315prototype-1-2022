## DESIGN JOURNAL

### **Design Hypothesis**<br>
For this prototype, I wanted to explore a different genre of a top-down game that combines 2D and 3D. Most top-down videogames follow a 2D format such as top-down shooters, arcade-style where you get the high score, and RPGs. Some games take a top-down format with 3D aspects, but they do not fully utilize the capabilities of having 3D aspects. One tends to overcome the other. I believe both can co-exist in a videogame where both excel equally. I use this prototype to see if such a thing is possible. I came up with a top-down adventure game on top of buildings. This scenario takes advantage of being 3D by potentially giving a sense of vertigo to the player with the top-down view of being on top of a building while having 2D gameplay. For this prototype, I focused mainly on the 2D gameplay and how it feels in a 3D environment.

### **Feedback & Reflection**<br>
Overall the feedback was mostly positive. However, thanks to my playtesters, they showed me all the areas I needed to improve, in my prototype, to fulfill my design hypothesis. Here are the reflections on those points based on my playtesters.

**Camera**<br>
The camera had positive comments overall. Its position gave the player a good sense of height and depth of field. Players were able to distinguish if they were jumping and if they could reach a platform. However, the camera has some bugs. Sometimes, it wouldn't follow the player at the start, and, during gameplay, its movement was inconsistent that the movement would look jittery. Additionally, the camera controls need to be more restricted to prevent any issues that would disrupt the gameplay, so the camera needs tweaking.

**Gameplay/Controls**<br>
The controls felt like your typical top-down game, and the gameplay felt like it wasn't your average top-down shooter. It made it feel different from most top-down games. The playtesters were able to see this game as a different genre that deviates from the classic shooter format. However, the gameplay/controls weren't refined enough to really deviate from the typical genre. The controls needed to be more refined before my prototype could actually make a name for itself. On the bright side, it is possible thanks to my playtesters.

**2D + 3D**<br>
The noticeability of my prototype containing both 2D and 3D aspects was a must. My playtesters were able to notice these aspects, but the 2D ones shined more than the 3D. This was a problem I was expecting because it is what most top-down games struggle with when combining both 2D and 3D. Thankfully, the playtesters gave suggestions. For the 3D, all it had was the height and depth, and that wasn't enough. I received suggestions about shifting the camera more and having a more detailed environment to really accentuate that the prototype takes place in a 3D environment. I plan on applying these suggestions if I choose to continue with this prototype.

**Conclusion**<br>
Overall, my prototype couldn't find the balance between 2D and 3D, and it was due to not experimenting with the camera and controls and not having a detailed enough environment. I was too focused on specific 2D and 3D attributes that I ended up leaving out a lot. Thankfully, I know what I miss now.

**Improvements**<br>
* Shift camera perspective (perhaps isometric view)
* More detailed environment
* Add new gameplay mechanics to deviate from the top-down shooter genre
* Fix camera and player control bugs
* Add additional obstacles (prolong gameplay)
